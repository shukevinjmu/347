            <h1>Blog post #7: Redux</h1>
            <p>
                Like you mentioned in your lecture 19 post, I decided to investigate Redux.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, I went and searched for why I should use Redux in the first place. I found <a
                    href="https://blog.logrocket.com/when-and-when-not-to-use-redux-41807f29a7fb/">this</a>
                article which covered what you mentioned in your lecture about a store keeping the application's state
                along with a how-to-use recap. One thing I liked about the article is
                that it also talked about when not to use Redux.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, like your mentioned, I looked for sources that use the newer hook system(useSelector and
                useDispatch). However, it was at this point that I realized I don't
                really know what a hook is. I remembered watching your videos implementing hooks, but I never really
                investigated further.
            </p>
            <p>
                I went to the reactjs page and read their <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html">Hooks
                    at a Glance</a> page which caught me up along with their
                <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html">api reference</a> page. Their overview
                summarized it nicely as "Hooks are functions that let you 'hook into'
                React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let
                you use React without classes".
            </p>

            <p>
                At this point I felt confident to tackle Redux's <a href="https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks">hooks
                    api page</a>. <br>
                After reading up on it, I found <a
                    href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/using-redux-with-react-hooks">this</a> article which did a nice
                side-by-side comparison of using Redux Hooks versus the previous connect way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below, you will find the code comparison provided by the <a
                    href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/using-redux-with-react-hooks">previously mentioned article</a>.

            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
import React from "react";
import { connect } from "react-redux";
import { addCount } from "./store/counter/actions";

export const Count = ({ count, addCount }) => {
  return (
    &lt;main>
    &lt;div>Count: {count}&lt;/div>
    &lt;button onClick={addCount}>Add to count&lt;/button>
    &lt;/main>
  );
};

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  count: state.counter.count
});

const mapDispatchToProps = { addCount };

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Count);
                </code>
            </pre>


            <p>
                Versus the React Redux Hook
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
import React from "react";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { addCount } from "./store/counter/actions";

export const Count = () => {
  const count = useSelector(state => state.counter.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    &lt;main>
    &lt;div>Count: {count}&lt;/div>
    &lt;button onClick={() => dispatch(addCount())}>Add to count&lt;/button>
    &lt;/main>
  );
};
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                Visually, React Redux Hooks are a lot cleaner and more concise. To me, this means that it is less
                error-prone which is great for me since this
                is my first time working with React in general.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking all of this up made me realize that web development is a lot different from the coding I've done
                at JMU. Most classes tended to avoid using
                any type of 'non-official' library or framework. Having the ability to quickly learn these is probably more relevant
                than what I've come to expect from classes which I am appreciative of.
