            <h1>Blog post #4: CAPTCHA</h1>

            <p>
                Today's blog post has to do with CAPTCHAs. To start, I went to <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/versions">Google's recaptcha</a> website. <br>
                I thought it might be helpful to get familiar with some of its implementations. For today's purposes, I did not validate the captcha with google's webserver.
            </p>
            <p>
                I went to <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create">this</a> site and registered a reCAPTCHA v2. This gave me a public/private key that would
                enable its usage on my website. Since I did not redirect my blogpost page to my
                domain name, I had to uncheck the following:
            </p>
            <img src="images/recaptcha.PNG" alt="verify origin of reCAPTCHA solutions">
            <p>
                I did this knowing of the security risk, and realize that this should never be done in an actual implementation. Once completed, I followed the instructions, and tried to enable the "I'm not a robot" checkbox captcha. 
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
&lt;script src='https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js' defer async>&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="site key">&lt;/div&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>With the above lines, I was able to apply the reCAPTCHA to the page. Next, I had to implement a way to see if the captcha was verified.<br>
                <a href=https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/verify>This</a> page detailed on how I would accomplish this. Since I don't know
                anything about PHP, I went with the following js:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
grecaptcha.getResponse();
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                With this bit of JavaScript, all I had to do was add some type of event listener and verify that the response was valid.<br>
                Below, you will find the implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="6LfdqtIZAAAAAMjwo-Z4JeXwmnsG3dRzTr2swigl"></div>
            </p>
            <p id=captcha-verify>
                CLICK THE CAPTCHA!
            </p>
            <button id="submit" onclick="startConfetti();">Then click here!</button>
            <p>
                Looking through this gave me an idea of how to implement a captcha, but more importantly, it made me realize that there is a lot I don't know (PHP &#128542;). 
            </p>
