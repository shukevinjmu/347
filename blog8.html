            <h1>Blog post #8: API calls/Grabbing information</h1>
            <p>
                Today's blog post revolves around doing research for Project 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                To breifly summarize, my project is basically an all-in-one news feed page. One thing I wanted
                to include in this was an option to allow youtube videos to appear on this page.
            </p>

            <p>First, I went to <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started"> here</a> to look at what I was dealing with.
                I followed the instructions on the page to obtain an API key, and enabled the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3">YouTube Data API v3</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next, I searched for how to grab the information I needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a few minutes of looking, 
                I found <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30475309/get-youtube-trends-v3-country-wise-in-json>this</a> helpful stackoverflow answer.
                To summarize, it broke down the query options: part, chart, regionCode, key, and maxResults.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now that I had this understanding, I was able to get the results I needed. <br>
                For now, I wanted to be able to get the 'trending' page for the USA. Specifically, I needed to get the video id to 
                embed it into the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                part = contentDetails<br>
                chart = mostPopular<br>
                regionCode = US<br>
                maxResults = 5<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                While unsafe for my API key, <a href=https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=contentDetails&chart=mostPopular&regionCode=US&maxResults=5&key=AIzaSyD1185OYX_nWpeUL0brDyGQaILu_ReEBaQ>
                here</a> are the results.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing I need to fully figure out is how to protect my API keys. Briefly searching brought me <a href=https://developers.google.com/maps/api-key-best-practices#:~:text=You%20can%20secure%20API%20keys,unexpected%20charges%20on%20your%20account.>
                here</a>, but I have yet to fully comprehend it. This might be a good thing to research in my next blog post as I will need to call multiple APIs in my project.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next, for my project, I also wanted to be able to grab the top x amount of posts from a reddit subreddit.<br>
                This process was far more simple since you don't need an API key to grab data from reddit.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/food/top/.json?count=20>https://www.reddit.com/r/food/top/.json?count=20</a> is an example of how
                you can easily get a json file. The previous link gets the top 20 results from the /r/food subreddit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most information I gathered either came from their <a href=https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api>api page</a> or from
                the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/"> redditdev subreddit</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                After doing this research for my project, I realized that it's really handy that all of this information is freely available. It would have been much harder/annoying
                to make some sort of script that scraped from the normal webpages.
            </p>
