            <h1>Blog post #3: MathJax</h1>
            <p>Today's blog post focuses on MathJax! During yesterday's peer review time, you recommended that I take a
                look at <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted">MathJax</a> if I wanted to create
                good looking Math text.
            </p>
            <p>
                My initial thought was, "why should I use this over simply creating an image of the equations?". Since I
                didn't know the answer, I went to google and found
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TairRxyy_Hs">this</a> video explaining why. In essence, it
                showed that my initial method was flawed for accessibility
                purposes. Things like screen readers would fail to interpret the img alt tag unless I wrote it in a 
                specific format.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the purposes of this blog post, I only integrated it on this webpage rather than on the server.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
&lt;script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"&gt;&lt;script&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                From their webpage, I obtained the above script source which would let me use MathJax.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, I went to an <a href=https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php?latex=D>online LaTeX Equation editor</a> since I haven't worked with it in a while. 
                For this purpose, I wanted to implement the quadratic equation. <br>
                From what I understood from the <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted">MathJax</a> site, I just had to add the LaTeX text between \\(  and \) or
                \\[ and \] in my html.<br>
                For example:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
\(\mathrm{x= \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^{2} -4ac}}{2a}}\)
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The result of this code is then shown below: <br>
                \(\mathrm{x= \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^{2} -4ac}}{2a}}\)
            </p>

            
            <pre>
                <code>
\[\mathrm{x= \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^{2} -4ac}}{2a}}\]
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                With the square brackets, the following is produced: <br>
                \[\mathrm{x= \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^{2} -4ac}}{2a}}\]
            </p>

            <p>
                Writing this blog post made me reflect on the job of a web developer. <br>Initially, I thought it was all about creating a good looking,
                non-bloated, and informative webpage. <br>I previously did not consider accessibility as a main factor which is almost essential
                for any education based page.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm glad that you told me about this tool, and I look foward to seeing what other tools exist that can improve a website(I think it would be a cool
                idea to have a page lisiting similar resources if you know of any for project 2. For example, I'm sure others will inevitably need to use something like MathJax).
