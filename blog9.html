            <h1>Blog post #9: CS 347 in review</h1>
            <p>
                With the limitation due to COVID, imagining a way to teach this course becomes difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                To start, I think this course was well designed. The blogs on your twodee website were incrediblely helpful to 
                my learning experience. Being able to rewatch videos, while sometimes a crutch, allowed me to learn in a very relaxed environment.
                I found that I rarely had to look at other sources to complete the labs/project which is honestly very different from some other courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing I would add to your blog posts are more references to <a href="https://info340.github.io/">this</a> online book that you linked
                in the first couple of lectures. I found that at times, when I didn't fully comprehend the videos, that having this text source provided clarity to the topic.
                I found that some of my peers didn't even realize that this site was a thing.
            </p>

            <p>
                As far as the in-class activities, I am in full support of the flipped classroom style where we do labs in class. One negative thing about the labs that
                I noticed was that there were students who rarely or even never talked during the lab. This would sometimes make it seem like my group of 4 people, was actually
                only a pair. While I understand that there might be anxiety involved or a general shyness, it did not seem very fair. While we had the ability to 'report' these
                inactions to you, realistically no one wants to be a snitch for a small assignment. These types of inactions continued even with Live Share.
            </p>
            <p>
                One way I could think that may help rememdy this issue, is to have everyone turn in their own copy of the lab. While this may promote solitude in some cases, it would
                atleast also promote that everyone is working. Whether they work together, or work alone, what they turn in would ultimately be fair (Maybe have a 2 pt grading scale. 
                0 = nothing/absent, 1 = something but very little, 2 = looks like they put effort).
                Additionally, I think that having a guarenteed copy of the lab is good for review purposes. When I wasn't the screen-sharer, I admittedly did not feel the need to 
                write my own copy while they screen-sharer wrote theirs.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the pacing of the course, I think that there should be less time allocated towards general HTML/CSS (Lectures 1-11).
                I found that the start of the course was extremely easy compared to the last 8-ish lectures (16-24). If it is possible to 
                expand the time spent on React/Node.js, I think it would be beneficial.
            </p>

            <p>
                To conclude, I really enjoyed this course. I felt that I was never in a rush to complete assignments like I am for other classes. I enjoyed being able to immediately
                see the fruits of my coding on the web, and actually had some fun. Additionally, I enjoyed your friendly attitude towards teaching. Things like your Haiku's (which I noticed
                that you took a break on those), made the environment seem more relaxed. I think things like that are good for teaching especially since most CS majors(including me) seem to
                be more introverted. While you couldn't see me since my webcam is off, I always smiled at those things.
