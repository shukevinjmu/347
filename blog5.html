            <h1>Blog post #5: JavaScript for Centralized Navbar?</h1>
            <p>***NOTE: To provide context to today's blog post, I wanted to let you know that I write these blogs while actively researching my desired goal to
                take the reader through the my thought process. As such, not everything always works out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today's blog post is focused on trying to load HTML with javascript for my navbar. The reason I wanted to do this is because
                I've been manually updating
                my blog's format(navbar/links) for each blog post which is tedious. <br>
                While you briefly showcased this in one of your videos, I thought it would a good exercise to try for
                myself.

            </p>
            <p>
                While googling, I saw that one issue with doing this happens when users block JavaScript. I imagine for
                robustness, it would be good
                to not do this for important content.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-load-external-HTML-into-a-div-using-jQuery">One
                    method</a> I found was using jQuery:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
$(document).ready(function(){
   
    $('#content').load("new.html");
                     
});
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                This appears to be the shortest(in code length) way which makes sense given that its jQuery. <br>
                For the sake of the post though, I wanted to search for a pure JavaScript solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                I found my answer in <a
                    href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3535055/load-html-file-contents-to-div-without-the-use-of-iframes/3535126>
                    this</a> stackoverflow
                post.<br>
                I then tried to replace my navbar with this:
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
fetch('navbar.html')
  .then(data => data.text())
  .then(html => document.getElementById('navbar-load').innerHTML = html);

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The above code served its purpose to load the html within the targeted div id. The only problem was that
                there were a lot of problems. <br><br>
                Initially, I put the bulk of my existing navbar/sidebar code within the navbar.html document. <br>
                However, through doing this, I found out that it broke most of my DOM JS references/messed with existing
                CSS files.<br>
                In addition, the content of the page would not load locally, which made me have to have a running site
                to check it.
            </p>

            <p>
                After about an hour of googling solutions to these issues, I realized the problem at hand was bigger
                than expected for this
                blog post. <br> Although, for all of it to not be in vain, I decided to re-evaluate my goal.

            </p>

            <p>
                I then found <a
                    href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/114744/loading-an-external-html-file-into-another-does-it-have-an-affect-on-seo">this</a>
                page where a similar user tried to implement what I did.
            </p>

            <p>
                The top reply noted that : "JS includes can be problematic for several reasons - search engines don't
                always process them properly, they are often not accessible to visitors using alternative technologies
                like screen readers, and like you said - this particular version isn't even outputting actual links."<br>
                <br> This made me realize that what I was doing was simply for the sake of convenience, and that I probably
                shouldn't try to load HTML with JavaScript for the purpose of a centralized navbar. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Although this blog post wasn't a success, I felt that it was still suitable since I taught me to not tunnel-vision/assume 
                functionality with my existing knowledge. Google exists for a reason, and I should probably use it before I start a project.
