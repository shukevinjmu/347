            <h1>Blog post #5: JavaScript to load HTML</h1>
            <p>
                Today's blog post is focused on loading HTML with javascript. The reason I wanted to do this is because I've been manually updating
                my blog's format(navbar/links) for each blog post which is tedious. <br>
                While you briefly showcased this in one of your videos, I thought it would a good exercise to try for myself.
        
            </p>
            <p>
                While googling, I saw that one issue with doing this happens when users block JavaScript. I imagine for robustness, it would be good
                to not do this for important content.
            </p>

                <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-load-external-HTML-into-a-div-using-jQuery">One method</a> I found was using jQuery:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
$(document).ready(function(){
   
    $('#content').load("new.html");
                     
});
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                This appears to be the shortest(in code length) way which makes sense given that its jQuery. <br>
                For the sake of the post though, I want to search for the pure JavaScript solution.
            </p>

                I found my answer in <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3535055/load-html-file-contents-to-div-without-the-use-of-iframes/3535126> this</a> stackoverflow
                post.<br>
                I then tried to replace my navbar with this: 
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
fetch('navbar.html')
  .then(data => data.text())
  .then(html => document.getElementById('navbar-load').innerHTML = html);

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                The only issue I had with this is that it broke my JavaScript DOM references for the side panel.
                This meant that when I clicked the button, the file did not work.
            </p>
